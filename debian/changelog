s3cmd (0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #438933).
  * Do not build for python2.3 as suggested by author (Closes: #432705).
  * No longer ship s3cmd.1 or setup.py in debian/ - upstream ones are ok.
  * Quilt is used to manage patches.
    - do-not-check-elementtree-at-build-time.patch added - ElementTree is
      only runtime dependency, no need to check it at build time.
